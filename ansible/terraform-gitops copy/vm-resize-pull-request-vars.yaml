pr_title: "feat: Change VM {{ instance_name_to_resize }} instance type to {{ new_instance_type }} per {{ req_id }}"
pr_body: >-
  This pull request was automatically created by an Ansible playbook to change the instance type
  of EC2 instance '{{ instance_name_to_resize }}' to '{{ new_instance_type }}' for request {{ req_id }}.

  **Instance being resized:** {{ instance_name_to_resize }}
  **Current instance type:** {{ current_instance_type | default('unknown') }}
  **New instance type:** {{ new_instance_type }}
  **Request ID:** {{ req_id }}

  **Note:** This change will require stopping and starting the instance, which will cause downtime.
